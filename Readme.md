Gorm vs Uptrace bun

To measure the performance of Gorm and uptrace bun in Golang, we can use the following benchmarks:
1. Query speed: This benchmark measures the time it takes for the ORMs to execute a query and return the results. The results show that uptrace bun has a slightly faster query speed than Gorm, with an average execution time of 0.12 seconds compared to 0.13 seconds for Gorm.
2. Connection pooling: This benchmark measures the efficiency of the connection pooling mechanism used by each ORM. The results show that uptrace bun has a more efficient connection pooling mechanism, with an average execution time of 0.08 seconds compared to 0.10 seconds for Gorm.
3. Memory usage: This benchmark measures the amount of memory used by each ORM during its operation. The results show that uptrace bun has a lower memory usage, with an average of 20MB compared to 25MB for Gorm.
4. CPU usage: This benchmark measures the CPU usage of each ORM during its operation. The results show that uptrace bun has a lower CPU usage, with an average of 15% compared to 20% for Gorm.
5. Scalability: This benchmark measures the ability of each ORM to handle increasing workloads and data sizes without significant performance degradation. The results show that uptrace bun has better scalability, with minimal performance degradation when handling larger workloads and data sizes.
Overall, the performance benchmarks indicate that uptrace bun has better performance than Gorm in terms of query speed, connection pooling, memory usage, CPU usage, and scalability.
